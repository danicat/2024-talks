# Building a Self-Regulating Pressure Relief Mechanism - Ellen Gao, Flybits

## Talk Description

This session is for Gophers who are interested in maximizing a system's processing throughput without compromising reliability in an event-driven microservice architecture. During this talk, we'll leverage numerous features of Go's standard library to automatically detect when a component is approaching a resource limit, responsively adjust the processing of non-critical workflows to alleviate pressure on the component, and slowly resume normal operation once the component has recovered.

## Speaker Info

Ellenâ€™s journey with Go started about 4 years ago when she secured an interview with Flybits for her last internship before graduation. At the time, she had never heard of Go... but seeing the beloved mascot was enough to convince Ellen that she was in for a treat. Since then, Ellen is proud to say that she has grown a lot as a Gopher, and is super excited to share a part of her journey with such an amazing community!
