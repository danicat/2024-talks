# You Can Store That In a Container Registry?! - Siva Manivannan, Replicated

## Talk Description

Modern container registries can store more than just container images. ORAS-Go (OCI Registry As Storage) is a library used to interact with registry content unrelated to container images, called OCI Artifacts. Using a small Go demo app, I will give a quick overview of how to interact with OCI Artifacts and the additional capabilities you gain by storing data in container registries.
