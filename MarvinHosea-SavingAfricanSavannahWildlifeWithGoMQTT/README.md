# Saving African Savannah Wildlife with Go-MQTT - Marvin Hosea, SCARATEC GmbH

## Talk Description

In this inspiring talk, I will discuss how we successfully built a reliable system with low latency on unreliable network wildlife zones, using Go with Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to monitor and protect endangered Savannah wildlife in Kenya, Africa.

Our team was entrusted with developing a system to help monitor and track wildlife subjected to environmental and humanitarian risks, but we were hampered by limited network coverage. I will explain how we went about developing a system to protect Savannah's endangered wildlife, such as elephants, rhinos, buffalos, and giraffes, in regions with low network coverage by leveraging the strengths of Go in combination with MQTT's efficient low latency, minimal network bandwidth, support for persistent sessions, and reduced resource requirements. I will also address some of the primary challenges encountered in attaining low latency.

Throughout the session, I will utilize our experience as an example to demonstrate how to design a reliable system based on the MQTT protocol with Go. I will also address some caveats and recommended practices and explain how attendees can unlock the full potential of systems in low-network coverage locations.
