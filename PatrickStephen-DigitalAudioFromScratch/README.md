# Digital Audio From Scratch - Patrick Stephen, StrongDM

## Talk Description

With just an `io.Writer` and no music or audio production pre-knowledge, we'll experiment with creating pitch and effects, and eventually complete compositions from scratch, entirely within a small Go program.

## Speaker Info

Patrick started using Go in 2015 after graduating from Carleton College, working with fellow alumni to build Oak, a pure Go game engine. He built backends for virtual reality software and satellite systems before landing at StrongDM where he has been architecting privileged access management systems for five years. He has a Masters focusing on experimental programming languages from the University of Minnesota.
