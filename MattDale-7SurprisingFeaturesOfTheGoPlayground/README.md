# 7 Surprising Features of the Go Playground - Matt Dale, MongoDB

## Talk Description

Most people know the Go Playground is a great tool for trying out Go code or sharing runnable code examples, but did you know it can do more? The Go Playground can display images and GIFs, provides a local network and filesystem sandbox, and even lets you clear the terminal output! You can write tests, define multiple code files and package directories, and fetch 3rd-party modules. There are also alternative Go Playground frontends that provide even more features!
