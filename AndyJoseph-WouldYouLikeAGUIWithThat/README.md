# Would You Like a GUI With That? - Andy Joseph, ProntoGUI

## Talk Description

Let’s say you need a GUI for your Go program.  Not a highly scalable solution that supports millions of users, but a fast way to visualize your software and easily change settings.  It’s too small of a job for a heavy-weight React solution and you don’t want to rely on the front-end team to make changes.  You need a GUI - pronto!

In less than seven minutes, Andy will demonstrate how to program a great-looking GUI for your service, or back-end software, without leaving the Go development environment.

## Speaker Info

Andy architected and developed several industrial control platforms that propelled the growth of a start-up company into a highly respected world leader in motion control and sensing systems for manufacturing. As a prolific inventor, he has been awarded various patents in software, industrial motion actuators, and sensing systems.

Most recently, Andy led the development of an IoT product that connects industrial equipment to plant-wide data analytics and historian applications using services written in Go.  

In his spare time, Andy enjoys spending time with his wife and three dogs. Together they enjoy hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing in the wonderful state of Michigan and elsewhere.
