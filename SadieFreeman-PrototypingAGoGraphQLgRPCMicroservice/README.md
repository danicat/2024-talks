# Prototyping A Go, GraphQL, gRPC Microservice - Sadie Freeman

## Talk Description

If you're trying to convince your team to move that old legacy code over to Go microservices, or if you're just curious about how to use GraphQL and gRPC with Go, then at some point you'll probably want to play with a prototype.

Prototyping a Go microservice, especially with different technologies like GraphQL or gRPC can be intimidating if you've never used them before, but we'll distill this down to a straightforward set of steps with code-along examples.

I'll show you how to build this up from a basic Go API to an app that provides a GraphQL schema for Client <-> Server communications, and a gRPC API for Service <-> Service communication. This mimics a common microservice architecture but in its most basic form. While some Go/microservice knowledge is helpful for context, this talk aims to be accessible for beginner to senior-level programmers, offering a ground-up explanation so a newer programmer can follow, and some more advanced tricks for this type of architecture.

## Speaker Info

Sadie is a Senior Backend Engineer and Tech Lead from the Canadian Rockies who has worked with Go microservices for the past six years. She deeply appreciates the humbling nature of the endless learning opportunities in this industry.

She previously worked in HR but re-trained as a developer through a coding boot camp and hopes to help make her slice of the tech industry more accessible for folks who feel like they “aren’t technical enough”.
