# Interface Internals - Keith Randall, Google, Go Team

## Talk Description

Ever wonder how interfaces work? How can a Go value hold alternately, an integer, a floating-point value, and a pointer? How do method invocations and type assertions work? If you've ever pondered any of these questions, this talk is for you.

We'll peek under the hood to see how the compiler and runtime conspire to implement interfaces. Performance-minded Gophers will learn techniques to make interface use lightning-fast.
