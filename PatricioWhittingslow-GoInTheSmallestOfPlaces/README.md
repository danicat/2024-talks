# Go in the Smallest of Places - Patricio Whittingslow, St√§mm Biotech

## Talk Description

Join us as we delve into the world of embedded systems, shedding light on Micro Controller Units (MCUs) and their practical applications in domains ranging from rocket motor control to biomedical processes. Surprisingly, we'll discover how Go, a language seemingly tailored for larger-scale applications, proves to be remarkably adept for embedded systems development, even outshining the most well-established languages in this domain.

## Speaker Info

Patricio started using Go as a hobby, soon after the Go language started to find its way into rocket control software at an aerospace startup, as well as a Biotech startup revolutionizing the continuous biomanufacturing scene, and more!
