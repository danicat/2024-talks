# Parquet, Go, and Unreasonable Amounts of SIMD - Achille Roussel, dispatch.run

## Talk Description

Parquet-go is a high-performance Go library for reading and writing parquet files. It utilizes advanced encodings and assembly-level optimizations to achieve extreme performance in projects like Grafana Tempo and FrostDB. Come learn about the algorithms implemented with AVX2 and AVX512 instructions, and nerd out on benchmarks that showcase how fast computers can be when we tap into SIMD!

## Speaker Info

Achille has worked as a software engineer on distributed systems in startups, as well as large companies like Twitch, Facebook, Segment, and Twilio, for the last 12 years. He has authored and participated in multiple open-source projects such as kafka-go, parquet-go, wazero, and recently contributed to the GOOS=wasip1 port of Go.

In 2023, Achille co-founded a startup to develop dispatch.run, a programming platform that drastically simplifies the creation and operation of reliable distributed systems.
