# Miles To Go, Golang for Competitive Programming? - Jacob Hochstetler, Fidelity Investments

## Talk Description

This talk covers the pros and cons of using Go in competitive programming and concludes with a demonstration of incrementally benchmarking prime number generation algorithms.

## Speaker Info

Jacob started his tech career at Sun Microsystems, where I learned “the network is the computer”. After discovering Go in 2015, I’ve been feverously (deviously?) modernizing legacy systems to Go.  In 2020, I became an Assistant Professor at the University of North Texas and have been converting students to Go ever since.
