# Exploring the Go Compiler, Adding a "four" loop - Riley Thompson, Flybits

## Talk Description

We will take a look inside the Go compiler, from parsing source files to generating machine code, by adding a new language feature: the "four" loop. After this talk, listeners will understand how their Go code is parsed, optimized, and translated into machine code, and feel comfortable diving into the Go compiler.

## Speaker Info

Riley graduated with a computer science degree in 2022. Since then he has been working as a backend engineer for Flybits, a company in Toronto.
